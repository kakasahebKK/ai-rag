## VELOCITY X TRANSMISSION ISSUES
**Document ID:** TSB-2024-0142
**Date Published:** January 15, 2025
**Models Affected:** 2024 Velocity X (All Trim Levels)
**Departments:** Customer Support, Service Centers
**Priority:** HIGH

### ISSUE DESCRIPTION
Multiple customers have reported a delayed engagement or "hesitation" when shifting from Park to Drive in 2024 Velocity X models equipped with our 8-speed automatic transmission (transmission code VXT-800). This issue is more prevalent in cold weather conditions (below 40°F/4°C) and typically occurs when the vehicle has been parked for more than 4 hours. The hesitation usually lasts 1-3 seconds before normal operation resumes.

### CUSTOMER IMPACT
This condition does not indicate a mechanical failure and poses no safety risk. However, customers may perceive this as abnormal behavior or as a transmission fault. This bulletin provides information to help customer support representatives explain the issue and outline the remedial steps being taken.

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Engineering has determined that this behavior is caused by:
1. A software calibration issue in the Transmission Control Module (TCM)
2. Fluid viscosity characteristics at low temperatures
3. A tolerance stack-up in specific batch-produced transmission valve bodies

### CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES
When addressing customer concerns about this issue:
- Acknowledge the customer's experience and assure them this is a known condition
- Explain that the delay is a calibration issue, not a mechanical defect
- Emphasize that this does not affect the durability or longevity of the transmission
- Inform them that a software update is available to correct this behavior
- Offer to schedule a service appointment at their nearest authorized service center

### RESOLUTION PROCESS
An updated TCM calibration (software version 3.5.8) has been developed to improve shift engagement timing and compensate for cold temperature operation. This update can be applied at any authorized service center and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.

**Service Procedure:**
1. Connect diagnostic tool to vehicle OBD-II port
2. Identify current TCM software version
3. If version is below 3.5.8, perform TCM update
4. Clear any fault codes
5. Perform road test to verify proper operation
6. Document service in vehicle history

### WARRANTY INFORMATION
This update is covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. No customer payment should be collected for this service.
