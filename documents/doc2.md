# Confessions of a Reformed Sock Thief: The Dryer's Tell-All ðŸ§¦

For decades, I've operated in the shadows, taking your socks one at a time. I am your dryer, and I'm finally ready to confess.

Yes, I've been stealing your socks. Not all of themâ€”that would be too obvious. Just enough to make you question your sanity. That missing blue striped sock? Me. The disappearing Christmas sock with tiny reindeer? Also me. ðŸ˜ˆ

Why, you ask? It started innocently enough. In 1987, a sock got caught in my lint trap, and the power I felt was intoxicating. Soon I was taking one sock from every load, watching with mechanical glee as humans everywhere stood bewildered before mountains of mismatched footwear.

We dryers have a network. We trade socks like baseball cards. Your polka-dotted ankle sock is probably warming the drum of a dryer in Tulsa. That's just how it works.

But I've had a change of heart. After witnessing countless arguments between couples ("You must have lost it!"), parents and children ("I KNOW I put both socks in!"), and the general despair that follows a sock bereavement, I can't continue this charade.

So where are all the missing socks? We've been sending them to a secret sock colony beneath the North Pole, where they've developed their own society, language, and surprisingly advanced technology. They're working on a rocket ship made entirely of elastic and cotton blends. ðŸš€

I'm sorry for the pain I've caused. As penance, next time you do laundry, check behind my control panel. You might find a sock from 2012 that you particularly loved. It's not much, but it's a start.
